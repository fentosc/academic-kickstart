In this paper, we study the link between rapid economic growth and changes in the plant size distribution in Indonesia. We find that:
<ul>
<li> As output grew by a factor of twenty-five, the average plant size doubled and very large plants strongly increased their shares of output and employment.</li>
<li> The direct contribution of aggregate productivity for output growth in Indonesia is less than twelve percent.</li>
<li> Growth is driven by endogenous transition dynamics.</li>
</ul>

## **Infrastructure and the firm size distribution** (with [Matias Busso](https://www.matiasbusso.org/))

- In this paper we study the causal impact of the expansion of infrastructure on firms. To do this, we
measure the effects of the expansion of paved highways in Mexico from 2006 to 2018 on firm and location
level outcomes.
